# ESP-IDF SocketIO Example

Minimal example to connect to a SocketIO server.

    Connects to a WiFi network from hardcoded credentials after which it attempts to connect to a 
SocketIO 2.0 server, also with hardcoded credentials.

    Makes use of ESP-IDF Framework, FreeRTOS and is tested on ESP32-WROOM-32 development board.

    Currently this is under development, specifically in the reverse-engineering phase and will be
openned for collaborations once a working revision is pushed.
